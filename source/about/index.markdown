I started coding some time ago, although I’m not entirely sure copying code from commodore magazines fully qualifies as coding but it sparked something that ended up with a career in software development. Now primarily working with Microsoft technologies I started my profession career in 2001 after graduating from [The Robert Gordon University](http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/) with a BSc (Hons) in Computing working with VB6 before moving to C# in 2002.

These days I’m still primarily working with C# and my role as Technical Lead at [BusinessPort](http://www.businessport.net) sees me working across a number of areas of our product lifecycle.
